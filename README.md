# Description

A companion for [GlyphAtlasCpp](https://github.com/Owlrazum/GlyphAtlasCpp/tree/GlyphAtlas) repo, to see rendered glyphs using Unity.


Worked with it only on MacOS. 
It needs compiled library using GlyphAtlasLib target in the GlyphAtlasCpp repo.
To test the project you need to add proper path variables to PluginLoader.cs for that library.
